In this replication package, you can find all the dataset we used in the paper. Datasets are located in the folder "dataset". The CSV files contains the sentence (column "sentence") and the sentiment expressed (column "oracle"). File "Labeled SO for CoreNLP.txt" contained all the sentences/nodes we labeled for training CoreNLP model, and the sentences are formatted as binary trees, which is required by the CoreNLP SentimentTraining component.
